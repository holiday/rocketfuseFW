Rocketfuse Framework 0.1

<h2>About the Framework</h2>
<p>This framework is being developed and maintained by RocketFuse. The sole purpose is to create an MVC style architecture that is very lightweight, easy to install and 
solve many tedious tasks web developers encounter. Basically we were tired of heavy weighh frameworks that had pages of documentation and little or no community 
support. This framework uses he Propel library for its object relational mapping. That is it, this how we intend to keep it. Any components we decide to add later will be modular and you will be able to choose whether to install it or not.</p>

<br />
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The best way to install this framework is simply performing a git clone. The framework ships with Propel's ORM already bootstrapped. The only dependancy is you need to install Phing to perform ORM related tasks. To install phing read the install documentation provided on Propel's site (http://www.propelorm.org/documentation/01-installation.html) under "Installing Dependencies". Once phing is installed you are set.</p>
